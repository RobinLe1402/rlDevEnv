# The RobinLe C/C++ Development Environment
This repository contains some global code for all my C/C++ repositories.


## Visual Studio Editor Configuration (`.editorconfig` file)
Put this file in a parent directory of the my C++ repositories, it's for automatic code formatting.


## Git Files (`.gitattributes`,  `.gitignore`)
These are configured for C/C++ and my default (UNIX-style) directory structure and located in the
root directory of my C/C++ repos.


## Visual Studio Property Sheets (`.props` files)
These files are copied into the root directory of the repos using them,
as they are included by relative path.

They contain project settings that are identical between different projects.
